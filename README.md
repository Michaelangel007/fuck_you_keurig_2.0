# fuck_you_keurig_2.0
Summary: Soft-mod and Hard-mod description to fix the broken-by-design DRM Keurig 2.0.


= Problem =

Greed corrupts everything.

When you use an non-"authorized" K-cup ...

 ![Non-authorized](0_choc_cup.jpg?raw=true)

... you get this shenanigans "Oops" message.

= Solutions =

There are 3 solutions:

1. Permanent (Hard modification)
2. Temporary (Soft modification)
3. Don't use or support corporate greed.

== Hard Mod ==

1. Cut the <font color="#080">green</font> wire

For more detailed instructions search You-Tube for: ["Keurig 2.0 hack"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=keuring+2.0+hack)

== Soft Mod ==

1. Use one official Keurig "authorized" K-cup.  Keep it from becoming damaged.
2. Turn it upside down.
3. Make a "shim" with a [X-ACTO hobby knife](https://www.google.com/search?q=X-Acto+hobby+knife&tbm=isch) by cutting off everything "above" the plastic O-ring.
4. Cut a hole/square in the middle.

Since a picture is worth a thousand words ...

![Shim Bottom](3_solution_shim_bot.jpg?raw=true)

To use the shim:

1. Lift lid
2. Insert "non-authorized K-cup"
3. Put the shim over top
4. Close the lid.

5. Give Keurig the middle finger for not respecting your time, space, or money.

6. Enjoy your beverage. (Finally!) 

 /sarcasm _"Oh noes!_ You're breaking the Law by circumventing DRM. How dare you use **your machine** _your way_ and not bow down to the corporate abuse of power."


== How it works ==

The white ring is encoded with data that identifies the manufactor and type of K-cup.
This "hack" tricks the sensor to "see" (read) the "authentic" white O-ring
making it "think" that the non-authentic K-Cup is actually authentic.

= Summary =

Congratulations humanity for reaching a new low on stupidity in 2014:

    DRM on Coffee / Tea / Hot Choculate? WTF!

There is only one appropriate (consumer) answer:

    Fuck You Keurig 2.0.
