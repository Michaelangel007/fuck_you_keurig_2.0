# fuck_you_keurig_2.0
Summary: Soft-mod and Hard-mod description to fix the broken-by-design DRM Keurig 2.0.


# = Problem =

_"I just want a cup of hot chocolate ..."_

Greed corrupts everything.

*sigh.*

When you (attempt to) use an non-"authorized" K-cup ...

 ![Non-authorized](0_choc_cup.jpg?raw=true)

... you get this shenanigans "Oops!" message:

 ![Oops shenanigans](1_problem_oops.jpg?raw=true)


# = Solutions =

There are 3 possible solutions:

1. Permanent (Hard modification)
2. Temporary (Soft modification), or
3. Don't use or support corporate greed. i.e Make it the old fashioned way, use another brand, etc.


## == Hard Mod ==

1. Cut the <font color="#080">**green**</font> wire 

 And here you thought all those dumb defuse-the-bomb movies couldn't teach you anything :-)

For more detailed instructions search You-Tube for: ["Keurig 2.0 hack"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=keuring+2.0+hack)


## == Soft Mod ==

1. Use one official Keurig "authorized" K-cup.  Keep it from becoming damaged.
2. Turn it upside down.
3. Make a "shim" with a [X-ACTO hobby knife](https://www.google.com/search?q=X-Acto+hobby+knife&tbm=isch) by cutting off everything "above" the plastic O-ring. You might also want to keep a "small lip" so it stays in place.
4. Cut a hole/square in the middle.

Since a picture is worth a thousand words (when you are trying to waste space) ...

An alternative solution is the [Freedom Clip](http://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=keurig+freedom+clip)


### === Shim Installation ===

To use the shim:

1. Lift lid
2. Insert "non-authorized K-cup"
3. Put the shim over top
4. Close the lid.

5. Give Keurig the middle finger for not respecting your time, space, or money.

6. Enjoy your beverage. (Finally!) 

 /sarcasm _"Oh noes!_ You're breaking the Law by circumventing DRM. How dare you use **your machine** _your way_ and not bow down to the corporate abuse of proprietary [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) for the sole purpose of commericial gain."

 When is this insanity of patents and not treating the customer with respect going to stop?

## == How it works ==

The white ring is encoded with data that identifies the manufacture and type of K-cup.
This "hack" tricks the sensor to "see" (read) the "authentic" white O-ring
making it "think" that the non-authentic K-Cup is actually authentic.


# = Summary =

Congratulations humanity for reaching _a new low on stupidity_ in 2014:

    DRM on Coffee / Tea / Hot Chocolate? WTF!

There is only one appropriate (consumer) answer:

    Fuck You Keurig 2.0.
