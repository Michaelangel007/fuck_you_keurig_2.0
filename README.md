# fuck_you_keurig_2.0
Soft-mod and Hard-mod description for the Keurig 2.0


= Problem =

Greed corrupts everything.

When you use an non "authorized" K-cup you get this shenanigans "Oops" message.



= Solutions =

== Hard Mod ==

1. Cut the green wire
For more detailed instructions search You-Tube for: ["Keurig 2.0 hack"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=keuring+2.0+hack)

== Soft Mod ==

1. Use one official Keurig "authorized" K-cup.  Keep it from becoming damaged.
2. Turn it upside down.
3. Make a "shim" with an X-Acto hobby knife by cutting off everything "above" the plastic O-ring.
4. Cut a hole/square in the middle.

To use the shim:

1. Lift lid
2. Insert "non-authorized K-cup"
3. Put the shim over top
4. Close the lid.


== How it works ==

The white ring is encoded with data that identifies the manufactor and type of K-cup.
This "hack" works because the sensor reads the "authentic" white ring tricking
the machine that the K-Cup is also authentic.
